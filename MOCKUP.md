# GUI Mockup

Modify this document to include information about your GUI mockups. You should
upload your mockup images to an image hosting site (e.g., 
[imgur](http://imgur.com/)), and include them in this Markdown document with 
descriptions. Let the rest of this document serve as an example.

**Note:** If you view this <code>MOCKUP.md</code> file on GitHub, the Markdown
syntax will automatically be rendered so that it looks nice in your internet
browser. You need click on the <code>Raw</code> button in the upper
right-hand side of the document (when viewing on GitHub) in order to view the
plain text version of the document. This plain text view is the same thing
you will see when editing your <code>MOCKUP.md</code> file using Emacs
or Vi.

**Note:** For more information on Markdown syntax, see the
[Markdown Syntax Documentation](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and the help page for 
[GitHub Flavored Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

## Main GUI

This is the original mockup. It contains the basic elements such as numbers to be entered and the operations to be used. It includes an area for the input to be displayed and the result to be displayed. Lastly, there is an area for the binary bits to go.

## GUI with Bit Toggle

This second mockup displays many improvements and is more detailed. The numbers are now displayed in individual buttons with color. The binary bits make an appearance and the elements of the application have an improved layout.

## Additional Interface Elements

You can include additional sections to this document as needed.
